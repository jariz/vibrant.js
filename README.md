## ⚠️ THIS REPO IS DEPRECATED ⚠️

Please file issues over on the [node-vibrant](https://github.com/akfish/node-vibrant/) repo, this repo is kept solely for historical reasons, but ongoing development will happen over there.
Despite node-vibrant's name, it works with both node and the browser (with and without UMD support).
**It is highly recommended you use that project over this one.**
